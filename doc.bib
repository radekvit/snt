Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the use of simulated annealing in the solution of the multi-objective examination timetabling problem. The solution method proposed optimizes groups of objectives in different phases. Some decisions from earlier phases may be altered later as long as the solution quality with respect to earlier phases does not deteriorate. However, such limitations may disconnect the solution space, thereby causing optimal or near-optimal solutions to be missed. Three variants of our basic simulated annealing implementation which are designed to overcome this problem are proposed and compared using real university data as well as artificial data sets. The underlying principles and conclusions stemming from the use of this method are generally applicable to many other multi-objective type problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
